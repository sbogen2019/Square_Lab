Similar to the same project in scratch, drawing letters with the Myro Simulator is much different than drawing basic shapes. For Drawing letters, one has to be much more precise in order to make it perfect. Drawing curves is nearly impossible, so I defaulted to straight lines for the S in my name. This was quite simple, for it only took 90 degree turns. However, it did not turn out quite as I expected. This is becaause this application codes for robots and as a result takes the robot into account. This made getting a perfect square, triangle, and S nearly impossible.
